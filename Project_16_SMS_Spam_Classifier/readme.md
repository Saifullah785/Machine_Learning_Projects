# üì© SMS Spam Classifier Project

This repository contains an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Machine Learning algorithms**. The project demonstrates the complete pipeline ‚Äî from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## üìñ Overview
Spam messages are one of the most common issues in modern communication. The goal of this project is to build an automated SMS classifier that can distinguish between **spam** and **non-spam** messages with high accuracy.  

This project walks through:
- Data exploration
- Text preprocessing (cleaning & transformation)
- Feature extraction using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**
- Model building & evaluation with different ML algorithms
- Final model deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Used an open-source SMS spam dataset.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and unnecessary characters.  
   - Tokenization and lemmatization.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Applied **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF** vectorization techniques.  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Tested multiple algorithms:
     - Multinomial Naive Bayes  
     - Random Forest  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Achieved **98%+ accuracy** and **99% precision** with Naive Bayes.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score were measured.  

6. **Deployment (Streamlit App)**  
   - Built a simple **Streamlit-based web app** for real-time message classification.
