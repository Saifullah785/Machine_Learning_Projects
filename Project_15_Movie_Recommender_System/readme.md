# 🎬 Movie Recommender System (Python | Machine Learning)

Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System** project 🚀  
This is an **end-to-end machine learning project** built in Python, designed to recommend movies to users based on similarity.  

🔗 **GitHub Repository:** [Movie Recommender System (Python)](https://github.com/Saifullah785/movie-recommender-system-python)

---

## 📖 Project Overview  

Recommendation systems are at the heart of platforms like **Netflix, Amazon Prime, and IMDB**.  
This project demonstrates how to build a **content-based recommender system** using **Python and Machine Learning**.  

It suggests movies to users by analyzing **similarities between movies** (based on genres, keywords, cast, crew, etc.).

---

## ✨ Features  

- 📌 End-to-End implementation (from data preprocessing to model deployment)  
- 📌 Content-Based Recommendation using **Cosine Similarity**  
- 📌 Clean and structured Python code with explanations  
- 📌 Well-documented learning project — easy for beginners to follow  
- 📌 Extendable for **web app deployment** using Flask/Streamlit  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data handling  
- **Scikit-Learn** – feature extraction & similarity computation  
- **NLTK / Text Processing** – optional (for better preprocessing)  
- **Pickle** – saving models  

---

## 📊 Dataset  

This project uses the **TMDB Movie Dataset** (public dataset).  
It contains metadata such as:  

- Movie ID, Title, Overview  
- Genres, Keywords  
- Cast & Crew information  

*(You can download the dataset from Kaggle or TMDB official dataset page.)*

## 🔄 Project Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean and merge multiple CSVs  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Extract key features (genres, keywords, cast, crew)  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create "tags" column (combined features)  
   - Convert text into vectors using **CountVectorizer**  
   - Apply **Cosine Similarity** to measure similarity between movies  

3. **Recommendation Function**  
   - Build a function that recommends top-N movies given a title  

4. **Model Saving**  
   - Save preprocessed data & similarity matrix using **Pickle**  

5. **Deployment Ready**  
   - Model is ready to integrate into **Flask/Streamlit Web App**
